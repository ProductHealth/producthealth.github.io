Product Health vision is "Longer and healthier lives for powered products" through the collection and analysis of
product metrics, feedback to users and remote control.

The Product Health [REST API](/api/reference/general-concepts) makes it easy to gather data from any product and organize them
meaningfully. The API documentation is organized to help you extract the most of your data.

The [General Concepts](/api/reference/general-concepts) section gives information common to each API resource.
The [Organizations](/api/reference/organizations), [Product Types](/api/reference/product-types),
[Products](/api/reference/products) and [Channels](/api/reference/channels) sections give details on each
available resources.
